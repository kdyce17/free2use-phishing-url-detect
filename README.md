# free2use-phishing-url-detect
This Repository contains the folders and files for our Final Year Project On Phishing URL Detect System.


INTRODUCTION

The internet has integrated seamlessly into our daily lives, but it has also made it possible to carry out harmful acts like phishing invisibly. CYBERATTACKER attempt to trick their victims by employing social engineering techniques or building fake websites in order to obtain information such as account IDs, usernames, and passwords from people and businesses. Although several strategies have been put out to identify phishing websites, CYBERATTACKERS have developed ways to circumvent these strategies. Machine learning is one of the best techniques for spotting these dangerous behaviors. This is so that machine learning techniques can recognize the common traits shared by the majority of phishing attacks.

INSTALLATION

Python 3.6.10 is used to write the code. Please download Python if you don't already have it installed. You can upgrade to the most recent version of pip by using the pip package if you are running a lower version of Python. After cloning the repository, enter the following command in the project directory to install the necessary packages and libraries:   
pip install -r requirements.txt
